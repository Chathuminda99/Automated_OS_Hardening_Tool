It seems like you want to ensure that the /tmp directory is correctly mounted with the appropriate options at boot time on your system. Here are the steps you can follow:

Run the following command to unmask the tmp.mount unit if it's currently masked:
Copy code
systemctl unmask tmp.mount
Modify the /etc/fstab file to include the tmpfs file system with the specific mount options that you require. You can use the following line as an example:
arduino
Copy code
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0
Make sure to adjust the options as per your specific requirements.

Alternatively, you can create a tmp.mount file in the /etc/systemd/system directory and configure it with the specific mount options that you require. You can use the following example as a template:
makefile
Copy code
[Unit]
Description=Temporary Directory /tmp
ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=!/tmp
DefaultDependencies=no
Conflicts=umount.target
Before=local-fs.target umount.target
After=swap.target

[Mount]
What=tmpfs
Where=/tmp
Type=tmpfs
Options=defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G
Again, make sure to adjust the options as per your specific requirements.

Once you have made the necessary changes, reload the systemd daemon to ensure that the changes take effect:
Copy code
systemctl daemon-reload
Reboot your system to verify that the /tmp directory is mounted with the appropriate options at boot time.

I want to know how to do 2 nd part?
Sure! Here are the steps to modify the /etc/fstab file:

Open the /etc/fstab file in a text editor with root privileges. For example, you can use the following command to open the file with the nano editor:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add the following line at the end of the file to configure the tmpfs file system with the specific mount options:
arduino
Copy code
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0
This line specifies the mount point (/tmp), the file system type (tmpfs), and the mount options (defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G). Again, you can adjust the options as per your specific requirements.

Save the changes to the /etc/fstab file and exit the text editor. In nano, you can press Ctrl+O to save the file and Ctrl+X to exit.

To test the changes, you can either reboot your system or remount the /tmp directory manually by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo mount -o remount /tmp
This will remount the /tmp directory with the new mount options specified in the /etc/fstab file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
